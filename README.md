# 🚀 Python & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Python & OOP learning repository**! 🎉  
This repo is a collection of **interactive Jupyter Notebooks** where I practice, explore, and document my progress in Python and Object-Oriented Programming.  

It is based on the amazing course **["100 Days of Artificial Intelligence" by Atıl Samancıoğlu](https://www.udemy.com/course/yapay-zeka-100-gunluk-kamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)** on Udemy.  
Here, I turned the lessons into my own structured notes, quizzes, and projects.

## ✨ What You’ll Find Here  
- 🔹 Python Basics → variables, lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  
- 🔹 Control Structures → if statements, loops, conditions  
- 🔹 Functions → reusable blocks of code  
- 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming → classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- 🔹 Special Methods → understanding Python’s magic (dunder methods)  
- 🔹 Quizzes & Examples → to test knowledge step by step  

💡 In short: This repo is not just **notes** – it’s a **hands-on learning path** for anyone who wants to strengthen Python fundamentals while diving into OOP concepts.
